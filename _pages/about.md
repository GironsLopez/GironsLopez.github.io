I am a hydrologist at the the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute ([SMHI](https://www.smhi.se){:target="\_blank"}). I mainly contribute to the Swedish, European (EFAS), and global (Aristotle) hydrological warning services. Other relevant tasks are ice break-up forecasting, large-scale flood forecasting, and long-range streamflow forecasting. My work lies at the confluence between research and production and my day-to-day includes communication, analysis of large datasets, model development, and quality control. 

My driving force is being able to contribute to social progress and well-being by reducing society's vulnerability to extreme events such as floods and droughts. I believe that achieving a sustainable development model is possible and I want to contribute with my grain of sand towards that end.

Besides water, I am a big enthusiast of the great outdoors in all seasons. I enjoy hiking, skiing, ice-skating, and paddling, among others. I enjoy music (both playing and dancing!) and thaught myself to play the guitar. One day I hope to do the same with the accordion, balalaika, recorder and ukulele.
