I am hydrologist at [Fortum](https://www.fortum.se/){:target="\_blank"}, working with inflow forecasting for hydropower production. Previously I have also worked at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute ([SMHI](https://www.smhi.se){:target="\_blank"}) contributing to the hydrological warning service and various research projects, and at the University of Zurich ([UZH](https://uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html){:target="\_blank"}) as a researcher.

With a cross-disciplinary background, I contribute towards improving social resilience and sustainability by working on water-related issues. I am continuously learning about hydrology and water resources management, but also about social behaviour and data analysis. Everything is connected!

Besides water, I am a big enthusiast of the great outdoors in all seasons. I enjoy hiking, skiing, ice-skating, and paddling, among others. I enjoy music (both playing and dancing!) and taught myself to play the guitar. One day I hope to do the same with the accordion, balalaika, recorder and ukulele.
