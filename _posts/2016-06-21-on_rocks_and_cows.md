Two weeks ago I visited the country of cows, chocolate, and clocks in order to attend the [13th Congress INTERPRAEVENT](https://interpraevent2016.ch/){:target="_blank"}, which took place in Lucerne. It was a conference focusing on natural disasters in the Alpine area and therefore, in addition to floods, there was a large focus on rockfalls and avalanches. It’s always interesting to get to know what other people do!

I was myself presenting a poster on a new manuscript relating social memory of past flood events with the efficiency of flood warning systems, which is now submitted for publication.
