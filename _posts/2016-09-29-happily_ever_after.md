Today marks the point when my PhD thesis is made public ahead of the public defence. After a long period in the making it is finally available [here](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?faces-redirect=true&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&af=%5B%5D&searchType=SIMPLE&query=&language=en&pid=diva2%3A957429&aq=%5B%5B%7B%22personId%22%3A%22margi345+OR+0000-0002-0835-8897%22%7D%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=-3723){:target="_blank"}.

The cover image shows the junction of two rivers, which represents the merging of different disciplines to advance the knowledge on water management.
