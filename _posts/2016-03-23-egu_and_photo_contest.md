This spring I will be going to the EGU conference in Vienna, Austria. I will be presenting some of my [recent work](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-15179.pdf){:target="_blank"} on the effect of risk awareness on the efficiency of early warning systems for natural disasters.

But that is not all! I am also participating in the EGU Photo Contest with some [pictures](https://imaggeo.egu.eu/user/m.girons/){:target="_blank"} of my trips. The photo “Living flows” has been selected as one of the finalist images and it will be exhibited during the conference:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/living_flows.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="Living flows"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Living flows
</div>

There you will be able to vote for it if you like it!
