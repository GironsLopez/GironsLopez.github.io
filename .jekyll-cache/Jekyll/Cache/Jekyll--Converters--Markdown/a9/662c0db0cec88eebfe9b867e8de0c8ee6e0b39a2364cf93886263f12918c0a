I"ù<p>This year was the first that I attended the EGU General Assembly. At first I was a bit skeptical as I had been told that the conference was so big that it was easy to loose focus and get lost in the frenzy surrounding everything. Also, checking the programme it was clear that it would be impossible to attend all the interesting talks and sessions. This was the state of mind with which I went to Vienna.</p>
