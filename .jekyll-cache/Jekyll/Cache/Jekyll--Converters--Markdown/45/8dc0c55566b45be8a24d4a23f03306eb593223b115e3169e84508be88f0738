I"�<p>This spring I will be going to the EGU conference in Vienna, Austria.
I will be presenting some of my <a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-15179.pdf" target="_blank">recent work</a> on the effect of risk awareness on the efficiency of early warning systems for natural disasters.</p>

<p>But that is not all! I am also participating in the EGU Photo Contest with some <a href="https://imaggeo.egu.eu/user/m.girons/">pictures</a> of my trips. The photo “Living flows” has been selected as one of the finalist images and it will be exhibited during the conference:</p>

<p><img src="/img/living_flows.jpg" alt="Living flows" /></p>

<p>There you will be able to vote for it if you like it!</p>
