I"�<p>Two weeks ago I visited the country of cows, chocolate, and clocks in order to attend the <a hrefhttps:////interpraevent2016.ch/" target="_blank">13th Congress INTERPRAEVENT</a>, which took place in Lucerne. It was a conference focusing on natural disasters in the Alpine area and therefore, in addition to floods, there was a large focus on rockfalls and avalanches. It’s always interesting to get to know what other people do!</p>

<p>I was myself presenting a <a href="https://interpraevent2016.ch/assets/editor/files/2016_05_30_18_31_16IP_2016_POSTER108.pdf" target="_blank">poster</a> on a new manuscript relating social memory of past flood events with the efficiency of flood warning systems, which is now submitted for publication.</p>
